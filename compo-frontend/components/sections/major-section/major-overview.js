          Hello there! Ed here and welcome to the new tutorial. I am a
          subscriber of @Pencilmation and I laugh and enjoy their animation. I
          thought of making a tutorial just like theirs, and here it is! I have
          another video on the works and hopefully be done on or before
          Christmas. I've been pushing myself to finish it, but for safety, I
          made this. I hope you guys are doing great and for the upcoming new
          year. Cheers! -ed
